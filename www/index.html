<!--

	COORDINATE AXES: -> CANVAS
	(1) Display a scene with default coordinate axes, where each axis is colored 
	(x-axis in red, y-axis in green, z-axis in blue).

	LOAD MODEL AND MODEL CONTROLS: -> MODEL 
	(2) Load 3D models in glTF 2.0 format and position them in space 
	(with options for translation, rotation, and scaling).

	MODEL PROPERTIES: -> MODEL
	(3) Display model properties: number of vertices, number of indices, and the size of the bounding box.

	PROCEDURAL GEOMETRIES: -> PROCEDURAL GEOMETRY
	(4) Add procedurally generated objects (plane, cube, sphere, torus).

	CAMERA CONTROLS: -> CAMERAS
	(5) Allow camera position and rotation control using mouse or keyboard input, 
	with the ability to change the camera's focal point.

	LIGHTS: -> LIGHTS
	(6) Place point lights in the scene, with adjustable parameters for color, 
	intensity, and attenuation (constant, linear, quadratic attenuation).
	(7) Define the lighting model (Lambert and Phong) and shading parameters 
	(diffuse and specular color, shininess) for each object.

	FRAGMENT SHADER: ->
	(8) Implement per-fragment lighting and shading calculations.

	TEXTURES: -> MODEL.TEXTURES
	(9) Assign textures to each object individually, with options for 
	texture coordinate mapping (input file coordinates, planar mapping, 
	cylindrical mapping, spherical mapping), and allow translation, rotation, 
	scaling, and projection direction for UV coordinates.

	GLOBALS:
	(10) Provide a global setting to control texture wrapping modes (CLAMP_TO_EDGE, REPEAT, MIRRORED_REPEAT).
	(11) Provide a global setting to control texture filtering modes (NEAREST, LINEAR) and mipmapping options.
	(12) Allow global enabling and disabling of mipmaps.
